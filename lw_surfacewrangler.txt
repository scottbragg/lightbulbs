Problem: 

Object1 has a large list of surfaces with several image nodes per surface using a UV map.  
Object2 has the same list of surfaces but a different name for it's list of uv maps. 

Need to duplicate surfaces from Object1 onto Object2.  All maps and surface settings are the same, only the uv map names need to change. 

Initial case:  
	Object1 has a single uvmap (myUVmap01) for the entire object.  
		All images use the same UVMap.
	Object2 has a single uvmap (myUvmap02) for the entire object.

Current solution: 

Save a material library for Object1 to disk.  Load material library onto Object2 and manually change uvmap selection on each image node in each surface for Object2 from myUVmap01 to myUVmap02.  Works but very tedious.

V1.0:
	Object based:
	Select Object:
		list of uvmaps
		list of surfaces
			list of nodes
				list of nodes with uvmap option
					list of current uvmap 

		Select new UV Map from list
		Make global change to selected object

	Surface Based:
	Select Surface:
		ID of object surface is assigned
		list of uvmaps on object
			list of nodes
				list of nodes with uvmap option
					list of current uvmap 

		Make global change to selected surface

	Global Change:

	No selected object or surface;
		List of Objects
		List of uvmaps
		List of surfaces
			list of nodes
				list of nodes with uvmap option
					list of current uvmap 

		Select new UV Map from list
		Make global change to all objects


v1.5: 
	Allow same functionality across all node data

v2.0:

	Add selection interface to allow drag-n-drop, multi-select changes, regex, searches, etc... across all surface node types and data types

v2.5: 
	Add same functionality (where feasible and logical) to nodes outside the surface editor.
	
v3.0:
	Global, scene level surfaces manager with multiple surface graphs, 'auto generated' compound nodes, integration of something simimilar to Nodemeister,  construction of sliders and other cross-node-type connectors, etc.
